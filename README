SCIM - Simple Clustering Infrastructure Management

This is a software package to manage network filesystem and service clusters.

It uses Glusterfs - http://glusterfs.org, as the cluster filesystem provider and
Linux Process Containers and Control Groups for cluster service management. It will also
make use of Linux Kernel Virtual - KVM for management of foreign operating systems that
are part of the cluster.
